### How to Install this Application & it's Dependencies ###

Before we start ensure that your machine has the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Note that the following versions were used in development:

NodeJS: v14.15.1 - NPM: 6.14.8

Once you have NodeJS and NPM installed and ready follow the following commands to install:

`git clone https://github.com/KLYE-Dev/hive.loans.git`
(this copies the project from github to your PC)


`npm install`
(this installs the projects dependencies)


After installation make sure to take a look at `.example.env` and create a file called `.env` with your relevant data in it.


Once that is complete you should be able to launch the program.

`npm start`
(this starts the application - Do Not Use Yet!)
